This is a very basic lavel ecommerce and facebook like app
in ecommerce section i have generated some dummy product.within app.you can see it in app main screen.Here for actual app i will use rxJava and retrofit for api call
In this ecommer section a user can add to cart,show cart and checkout.I did not do any fuction for cart but in real app all fuctions will be.
Facebook like app need backend server for post text,image,photo etc but i don't have a server so i just implement a dummy server call from "typicode" api that fetch
user id,post title,post body etc.
To see this click in facebook icon
Here i have used rxJava and rerofit to call API.
I don't have idea about Django but I am expert in Spring boot.
